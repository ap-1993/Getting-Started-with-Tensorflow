# Getting-Started-with-Tensorflow
Capstone Project for Getting Started with Tensorflow 2.0 on Coursera

We create an image classifier for the SVNH dataset using a simple MLP as well as a CNN model and compare their respective accuracy. 
We find CNN to be much more accurate than MLP eventhough it has fewer parameters.
